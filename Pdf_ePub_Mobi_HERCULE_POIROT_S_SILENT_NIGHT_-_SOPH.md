Overview

    
        
            â€˜The main danger, as I see it,   is that you and I will be trapped here for the whole of the Christmas   holiday!â€™
            
            Itâ€™s 19 December 1931 and Hercule Poirot and Inspector Catchpool are called   to investigate a brutal murder in a Norfolk hospital. Catchpoolâ€™s mother, the   irrepressible Cynthia, insists that they stay with her nearby so that they   can all be together for the festive period while Poirot finds the killer.   Cynthiaâ€™s friend is being admitted to the same hospital and she is convinced   he will be the next victim.
            
            Poirot has less than a week to solve the crime and prevent more murders, if   he is to escape from this nightmare scenario and get home in time for   Christmas. Meanwhile, someone else â€“ someone utterly ruthless â€“ has other   ideas about what ought to happen to Hercule Poirotâ€¦
