Overview
Charting West Hams tumultuous 2022â€“23 season and epic triumph in the Europa Conference League final, this is the story of how the Hammers defied the odds to win their first trophy in forty-three years and first European trophy in fifty-eight years. After weathering misfiring signings, dissent among the fans and the near-sacking of David Moyes, the Irons eventually secured Premier League survival and found spectacular redemption in the Europa Conference League. They played fifteen games in Europe and were unbeaten. Captain Declan Rice ended his West Ham career by lifting a trophy, just like Bobby Moore and Billy Bonds before him. The outpouring of joy at the final whistle in Prague will never be forgotten by the clubs fans, many of whom were too young to have seen their team win its last trophy. Packed with hilarious anecdotes and whimsical musings, this is West Hams extraordinary 2022â€“23 season as told by superfan Pete May, who lived (and occasionally suffered) through every nail-biting moment and crucial game. Experience the goals, games and glory all over again in this witty and impassioned book â€“ essential reading for any Hammers fan.
